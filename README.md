## Personal Note

As GSoC'24 draws to a close, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to my mentor, **Mabud Alam**, for his unwavering guidance and support throughout the project. Working on [Beacon](https://github.com/CCExtractor/beacon) has been an incredibly rewarding experience, and I'm excited to continue contributing to **CCExtractor** and the broader open-source community. Let's keep the momentum going! ðŸš€
